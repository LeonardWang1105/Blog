 [a] It is possible to generalize the rule of concord to 'A subject which is not clearly semantically 
plural requires a singular verb'; that is, to treat singular as the unmarked form, to be used in 
neutral circumstances, where no positive indication of plurality is present. This would explain, 
in addition to clausal subjects, the tendency in informal speech for is/was to follow the pseudosubject there in existential sentences such as There's hundreds of people on the waiting list (cf 
18.44n. Similarly, interrogati9e who and what as subjects normally take a singular verb even 
when the speaker has reason to believe that more than one person or entity is involved: Who is 
making a// that noise?However, a plural verb may be used if other words in thesentence indicate 
that a plural subject:is expected in the answer (Who have not receiued theirposses?). 
On the other han'd, the principle of proximity (cf 10.35) effects a change from singular to 
plural more often than the reverse, perhaps because the plural is the form that ismorphologically 
unmarked. 
[b] Apparent excephons to the concord rule arise with singular nouns ending with the -S of the 
plural inflection (measles, billiads, mo!hema!ics, etc, cf 5.75). or conversely plural nouns lacking 
the inflection (cattle,people, clergy, etc. cf 5.78): 
Measles is sometimes serious. Our people are complaining. 
[c] Plural phrases (inpluding coordinate phrases) count as singular if they are used as names, 
titles, quotations, etc (cf further 17.90): \ 
Crime and Punisllment is perhaps the best constructed of Dostoyevsky's novels, but The 
Brothers Karamazou is undoubtedly his masterpiece. 
'The Cedars'has a huge garden. 
'Senior citizens'means, in common parlance, people over sixty. 
Such noun phrases can be regarded as appositive structures with an implied singular head: the 
book 'Crime and Punrbhment', the expression 'senior citizens'. The titles of some works that are 
collections of stories, ktc, may be counted as either singular or plural: 
The Canterbury Tales {zy} in many manuscripts. . , 
[d] On the treatment of data, media, criteria, and phenomena as singular nouns, c/ 5.91, 5.98 
Note. 
[e] Zero plural nouns (c/ 5.86) do not display number. Hence, when they are subject and the verb 
is a modal or simple past, number differences manifest themselves only covertly through pronoun 
reference (c/ covert gender, 5.104): 
The sheep jumped over the fence, didn't "? {they? 
[a It is a peculiarity of English that -S is the regular inflection for singular in the verb but for 
plural in the noun. 

Principles of grammatical concord, notional concord, 
and proximity 
10.35 The rule that the verb matches its subject in number may be called the 
principle of GRAMMATICAL CONCORD. Difficulties over concord arise through 
occasional conflict between this and two other principles: the principle of 
NOTIONAL CONCORD and the principle of PROXIMITY. 
Notional concord is agreement of verb with subject according to the notion 
of number rather than with the actual presence of the grammatical marker 
for that notion. In British English, for example, collective nouns such as 
government are often treated as notionally plural: 
The government have broken all their promises. (BrE) 
In this example, the plural notion is signalled not only by the plural verb 
have, but also by the pronoun their. 
The principle of proximity, also termed 'attraction', denotes agreement of 
the verb with a closely preceding noun phrase in preference to agreement 
with the head of the noun phrase that functions as subject: 
?No one except his own supporters agree with him. 
The preceding plural noun supporters has influenced the choice of the plural 
verb agree, although the subject No one except his own supporters is 
grammatically singular, since the head no one is singular. On the other hand, 
the proximity principle is here reinforced by notional concord ('Only his own 
supporters agree with him'), making the sentence somewhat more acceptable 
than if the proximity principle alone applied. The choice of the verb may 
also be influenced by preceding coordinated noun phrases, even if they are 
singular: 
?*A good knowledge of English, Russian, and French are required for 
this position. 
Conflict between grammatical concord and attraction through proximity 
tends to increase with the distance between the noun phrase head of the 
subject and the verb, for example when the postmodifier is lengthy or when 
an adverbial or a parenthesis intervenes between the subject and the verb. 
Proximity concord occurs mainly in unplanned discourse. In writing it will 
be corrected to grammatical concord if it is noticed. 
The three principles and their interaction will be illustrated below in three 
areas where concord causes some problems: where the subject contains (a) a 
collective noun head; (b) coordination; and (c) an indefinite expression. 
English speakers are often uncertain about the rules of concord. 
Prescriptive teaching has insisted rather rigidly on grammatical concord, 
with the result that people often experience a conflict between this rule and 
the rule of notional concord, which tends to prevail over it. When the 
proximity principle is followed in defiance of the other principles, the result 
is likely to be condemned as an error. 
Note [a] The principle of notional concord accounts for the common use of a singular with subjects 
that are plural noun phrases of quantity or measure. The entity expressed by the noun phrase is 
viewed as a single unit:

Ten dollars is all I have left. ['That amount is. . .'l 
Fifteen years representsa long period of his life. ('That period is. . .'l 
Two miles is as far as they can walk. ['That distance is. . .'] 
Two thirds of the area isunder water. ['That area is. . .'l 
C/: Sixypeople meansa hugeparty. ('That number of people means. . .'l 
[b] We also find a type of number concord at the phrase level in that certain determiners agree 
in number with their noun heads that idea, those ideas. There are apparent exceptions with 
measure noun phrases: 
tltat five dollars (also: those five dollars) every few miles 
this last two weeks(also: these last two weeks) each ten ounces 
another two days another five per cent 
a happy three months 
A few and a gwdmany function as units: 
agood many friends a few days 
[cl Grammatical concord is usually obeyed for more than and many a, though it may conflict 
with notional concord: 
More than a thousand inhabitants haue signed the petition. [l] 
More than one member has protested against the proposal. L21 
Many a member has protested against the proposal. [31 
Although the subject is notionally plural in 121 and [3], the singular is preferred because member 
is analysed as head of the noun phrase. Contrast: 
~n~","e~~~sthan haul protested against the proposal. 
Collective nouns and notional concord 
10.36 Singular collective nouns may be notionally plural. In BrE the verb may be 
either singular or plural: 
The audienbe were enjoying every minute of it. [l] 
The public are tired of demonstrations. [21 
England have won the cup. [31 
Our Planning Committee have considered your request. L41 
The choice between singular or plural verbs depends in BrE on whether the 
group is being cqnsidered as a single undivided body, or as a collection of 
individuals. Thus,, in BrE plural is more likely in [l] than singular, because 
attention is directed at the individual reactions of members of the audience. 
On the other hand, the singular is more likely in these sentences: 
The audience was enormous. 
The public cynsists of you and me. 
The crowd hps been dispersed. 
In contrast to [la], The audience were enormous might be interpreted to refer 
to an audience of enormous people. On the whole, the plural is more popular 
in speech, whereas in the more inhibited medium of writing the singular is 
probably preferred. It is generally safer in BrE to use the singular verb where 
there is doubt, in obedience to grammatical concord. 
AmE generally treats singular collective nouns as singular. Terms for the 
government and for sports teams are nearly always treated as singular in 
AmE, but other terms may (less commonly than in BrE) take plural verbs: 
The administration has announced its plans forstimulating theeconomy. 
America has won the cup. 
The public has a right to know. [also in AmE: The public have a right to 
know.] 

But, as in BrE, plural pronouns are often used in AmE to refer to singular 
collective nouns: 
The committee has not yet decided how they should react to the 
Governor's letter. 
Note [a] If thecollective noun subject occurs in the plural, the verb is of course plural in both BrE and 
AmE: The various committees are now meeting to discuss yourproposal. 
[b] When a noun referring to a collection of people has plural concord, the pronouns for which 
it is antecedent tend to be who/whom/they/them rather than whichlit. Compare: 
a family who quarrel amongst themselws 
a family which dates back to the Norman Conquest 
[c] Couple in the sense of two persons normally has a plural verb even in AmE: The couple are 
happily married. When it denotes a unit, the singular verb is used: Each couple was asked to 
complete a form. 
Coordinated subject 
Coordination with and 
10.37 When a subject consists of two or more noun phrases (or clauses) coordinated 
by and, a distinction has to be made between coordination and coordinative 
apposition (cf 10.39). 
Coordination comprises cases that correspond to fuller coordinate forms. 
A plural verb is used even if each conjoin is singular: 
Tom and Alice are now ready. ['Tom is now ready and Alice is 
now ready.'] 
What I say and what I think are my own affair. ['What I say is my own 
affair and what I think is my own affair'; but cf: What Zsay anddo is 
my own afair, 10.381 
A plural verb is similarly required in asyndetic coordination (without a 
coordinator): 
His camera, his radio, his money were confiscated by the 
customs officials. 
Conjoins expressing a mutual relationship (cf 13.60), even though they can 
only indirectly be treated as reductions of clauses in this way, also take a 
plural verb: 
Your problem and mine are similar. ['Your problem is similar to mine 
and mine is similar to yours.'] 
What I say and do are two different things. ['What I say is one thing 
and what I do is another thing.'] 
Note [a] If a singular noun phrase is followed by etc and similar abbreviatory expressions (and so on, 
andsoforth), a plural verb is normal: 
The size etc are less important for our purposes. 
[bl Preposed each or euery has a distributive effect and requires a singular verb: 
Every adult and every child was holding a flag. 
Each senator and congressman was allocated two seats. 
Contrast: 
Each of them has signed the petition. They haw each signed the petition. 

[C] The coordination markers respectiue and respectiuely (cf 13.62n occur in coordination, but 
not in coordinative apposition. 
[d] The principle of notional concord explains: 
The hammer and sickle was flying from the flagpole. 
Danish bacon and eggs makes a good solid English breakfast. 
The Bat and Ball sells good beer. 
Despite the coordination, the subject names a single flag, a single meal, and a single pub 
respectively. Contrast: 
Danish bacon and eggs sellvery well in London. 
[e] Arithmetical sums may be used with a singular or plural verb: 
Two and two{fre}four. 
So also Ten timesfiue is (or are)fijry; Twofiues make (or makes) ten. But Twofiues are ten; Ten 
minus two is eight; Ten intofirfly isfiue. 
Coordination within a singular subject 
10.38 A singular noncount noun head may be premodified by phrases coordinated 
by and. As subject, the resulting noun phrase may imply two (or more) 
separate sentences, and may then be legitimately followed by a plural verb: 
American and Dutch beer are (both) much lighter than British beer. 
['American beer is . . . and Dutch beer is. . .'] 
White and brown sugar are (equally) acceptable for this recipe. 
But a singular verb is often used in this context, and is required when the 
phrases are postmodifying: 
Beer from America and Holland is much lighter than British beer. 
When the subject is a nominal relative clause, coordination reduction 
allows some variation in number interpretation: . 
What I say and do are my own affair. ['What I say is. . . and what I 
do. . .':; cf 10.371 
What I say and do is my own affair. ['That which I say and do. . .'] 
A generic noun phrase with a singular count head requires a plural verb 
when the head ,is premodified and the premodification contains coordination 
by and: I 
i \ 
The short-term and (the) long-term loan are handled very differently by 
the bank. 
A first-language and (a) second-language learner share some strategies 
in their acquisition of the language. 
These noun p$rases are notionally plural ('short-term and long-term loans'; 
'first-language and second-language learners'). 
Coordinative apposition 
10.39 With the less, common CooRDrNATIvE APPOSITION, no reduction is implied, 
since each of the coordinated units has the same reference. Hence, a singular 
verb is required if each noun phrase is singular: 
This temple of ugliness and memorial to Victorian bad taste was 
erected in the main street of the city. 

The two opening noun phrases here both refer to one entity (a statue). The 
following example, however, could have either a singular or plural verb, 
depending on the meaning: 
His aged servant and the subsequent editor of his collected papers {E~] with him at his deathbed. 
Singular was is used if the servant and the editor are the same person, and 
plural were if they are two different people. 
Some latitude is allowed in the interpretation of abstract nouns: 
Your fairness and impartiality {tze] been much appreciated. 
Her calmness and confidence astonishing. {:re} 
Law and order {tze} been established. 
Invoking the principIe of notional concord, we may use either singular or 
plural, depending on whether qualities are seen as separate or as a complex 
unity. 
Note [a] The correlatives both. . . and. . . (c/ 13.35) mark coordination in subject noun phrases: Both 
her caln~nessand her confidenceareastonishing. Withsubject wmplements they markcoordinative 
apposition: She is both secretary and treasurer. Contrast: 
Both my wife and my secretaly were there. [two persons] 
She was both my wife and my secretary. [one person] 
[b] Noun phrases are usually apposed without a coordinator. If they are subject, a singular verb 
is of course required if the noun phrases themselves are singular: 
This templeof ugliness, a memorial to Victorian bad taste, war erected in the main street of 
the citv. 
[C] A repeated determiner biases the choice to plural: 
Your fairness and your impartiality have been much appreciated. 
Quasi-coordination 
10.40 Subject noun phrases may be linked by quasi-coordinators (cf 13.103), ie 
prepositions (such as along with, rather than, and as well as) that are 
semantically similar to coordinators. Grammatical concord requires a 
singular verb if the first noun phrase is singular: 
The captain, as well as the other players, was tired. 
One speaker after another was complaining about the lack of 
adequate sanitation. 
Occasionally the principle of notional concord (sometimes combined with 
the proximity principle) prompts the plural, especially in loosely expressed 
speech: 
?One man with his wife, both looking very anxious, were pleading with a l guard to let them through. 
?The President, together with his advisors, are preparing a statement on 
the crisis.
