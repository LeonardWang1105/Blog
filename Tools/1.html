      <div class="col-md-12 h-100">
        <div id="topBar" class="sticky-top"> The difference is clearer
          for [la] and [2a]. In [la] tomorrow is identified as Sunday,
          the latter having the function of subject complement and the
          role of identifying attribute. In [2a], on the other hand,
          next month appears to be a fronted adverbi,hl with consequent
          subject-verb inversion ('Our wedding anniversary takes place
          next month', cf: Our wedding anniversary is in January. - In
          January is our wedding anniversary.) With one type of
          exception, the correspondence also applies for the (b) set
          when an adverbial is present that is a noun phrase or a
          prepositional phrase containing a noun phrase: It's too windy
          in Chicago. .V Chicago is too windy. It was sunny yesterday.
          Yesterday was sunny. The exception is when the verb is not a
          copula (for example, rain or snow): It's raining in
          Manchester. .r *Manchester is raining.<br>
          <br>
          The correspondence generally applies for the (c) set: It's not
          far to York. -York is not far. It's only a hundred miles from
          here to Philadelphia. -Philadelphia is only a hundred miles
          from here. The (c) set readily allows prepositional phrases as
          subject (cf 10.15): To York is not very far. From here to
          Philadelphia is only a hundred miles. <br>
          <br>
          e [a] Prop it has also been termed 'ambient' it, in accordance
          with the view that it has some generalized reference to the
          environment in a given context. Thus, we can use it for a more
          restricted environment in It's too muddy to walk. In clauses
          of time and weather the environment may be general and
          unspecified, but it may be specified by a locative or temporal
          phrase, as in It was very chilly in my bedroom or in some of
          the examples given above. Another term for prop it is
          'expletive'it, the term indicating the view that this it
          merely fills a syntactic gap (that of subject) and is
          otherwise meaningless. [b] On other uses of it as a personal
          pronoun, c/ 6.15J The prop subject it here should be
          distinguished from the anticipatory it of sentences like If
          was a great pleasure to see you again (c/ 18.33h, where it has
          cataphiric reference to a postponed clausal subject (To see
          you again was a great pleasure). <br>
          <br>
          Locative object 10.27 We turn now to roles of the direct
          object. The most typical role of the direct object, that of
          the affected participant, has been mentioned in 10.19. The
          direct object may have a LOCATIVE role with such verbs as
          walk, swim, pass, jump, turn, leave, reach, surround, cross,
          climb (cf further examples in 9.31): We walked the streets.
          ['We walked through the streets.'] She swam the river. ['She
          swam across the river.'] He passed a cyclist. ['He passed by a
          cyclist.'] The horse jumped thefence. ['The horse jumped over
          the fence.'] Superficially, these objects may seem to be
          adverbials with an omitted preposition (cf: We stayed three
          days, 9.40ff). In most cases their status as objects is clear,
          however, from their ability to assume subject role in a
          corresponding passive clause, eg: The fence was jumped by the
          horse. <br>
          <br>
          [a] We should include here locative objects after such verbs
          as occupy and inhabit, where no preposition can be inserted:
          We occupy a spacious apartment. They had inhabited the island
          for over a century. BrE may have a locative object after
          visit: They are visiting Amsterdam. AmE, on the other hand,
          restricts the direct object to personal reference, and
          requires uisit in for places. In informal AmE, visit with is
          used in the meaning 'chat with': I was visiting with Carol
          yesterday outside the bank. [b] A related category of object
          consists of phrases of extent (He ran a mile; cf10.13). <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Resultant object 10.28 A RESULTANT object is an object whose
          referent exists only by virtue of the activity indicated by
          the verb: <br>
          Baird invented television. They are designing a new car. John
          has painted a new picture. She made afire. I'm writing a
          letter. I baked a cake.<br>
          <br>
          With an agentive subject and an affected object, one may
          always capture part of the meaning of aclause (eg: Xdestroyed
          Y) by saying 'X did something to Y'; but this does not apply
          to a resultant object: Baird invented television does not
          imply 'Baird did something to television'. Contrast the
          affected object in I'm digging theground with the resultant
          object in I'm digging a hole. In one type of resultant object,
          the activity recreates the referent: <br>
          <br>
          She acted the part of Ophelia. They are playing the Egmont
          Overture. <br>
