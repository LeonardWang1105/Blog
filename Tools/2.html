            e [a] Other terms for the resultant object are&#39;object of result&#39; and &#39;effected object&#39;. [b] We should distinguish between I baked a cake, where a cake is resultant, and I baked some potatoes, wheresomepotatoes is affected. Contrast similarly: Shecooked a meal. [resultant] She cooked some carrots. [affected] He&#39;s frying an omelet. [resultant] He&#39;s frying an egg. [affected] [c] In some cases it may be unclear whether the activity createsor recreates the referent: Janet told me a joke.
 </p>
            <p>
                Cognate object 10.29 A COGNATE object is similar to a resultant object in that it refers to an event indicated by the verb: Chris will sing a song for us. She lived a good life. They fought a cleanfight. He breathed his last breath. He died a miserable death.
 </p>
            <p>
                In this type of Abject, the noun head is semantically and often morphologically related to the verb. The object can therefore not be considered a participant. Its semantic function is to repeat, wholly or partially, the meaning of the verb. Most cognate objects tend to convey a rather orotund style. The noun is generally modified. The verb and theobject are then equivalent to the verb an&amp;,a corresponding adverbial:</p>
            <p>
                They fought a cleanfight. They fought cleanly.
 </p>
            <p>
                ote [a] The object of ran a race might also be classed as a cognate object, although it is like a locative object in being replaceable by a prepositional phrase: ran in a race. [b] There are rare cases in which it is the meaning of the subject that is presupposed by the verb: The frost froze har Day dawned, The wind is blowing.
 </p>
            <p>
                Eventive object a wave 10.30 A frequent type of object generally takes the form of a.deverba1 noun preceded by a common verb of general meaning, such as do, give, have, make, take. This EVE&#39;WIVE object (cf 10.25) is semantically an extension of the verb and bears the major part of the meaning. Compare:</p>
            <p>
                They are arguing. [verb only]
 </p>
            <p>
                They are having an argument. [verb + eventive object]
 </p>
            <p>
                The more frequent eventive object can sometimes be related to a cognate . object in that it substitutes for the major lexical meaning of the verb whereas the cognate object repeats the lexical meaning. Compare:</p>
            <p>
                Theyfiught for a long time. [verb + adverbial] <br/>
                They fought a longfight. [verb + cognate object] <br/>
                They had a longfight. [verb + eventive object] <br/>
 </p>
            The construction with the eventive object provides greater weight than the corresponding SV type, especially if there are no optional adverbials, and is often preferred to the SV construction in informal English. Some noun heads in eventive objects are not derived from verbs. For example there is no verb effort, although an effort is eventive in I&#39;m making an effort, and whereas work in He did some work is deverbal, there is no related verb for homework in He did some homework; other examples: have a game, have a haircut, make fun (of), make peace (with), (c$ make war (on)).In some instances, the verb is not normally used intransitively: I made a mistakelan attemptla correction. In other instances, the combination clearly does not have the same meaning as the verb alone, eg: make love (to), take trouble (over), make a dgerence. In a few instances, the combination has (or may have) a passive meaning, particularly with have:
            <br />
            I had a fright. [&#39;I was frightened.&#39;]
            <br />
            The baby&#39;s having a bath. [&#39;The baby is being bathed.&#39;]
            <br />
            I&#39;ll have a shampoo, if I may. [&#39;I want my hair to be shampooed.&#39;]
            <br />
            He took offence at my remarks. [&#39;He was offended by my remarks.&#39;]
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are some common collocations.of verb and eventive object where the noun heads in the object are derived from verbs:
            <br />
            DO adance a leftlright turn a somersault
            <br />
            a dive a report a translation
            <br />
            a drawing a sketch some work<br />
            <br />
            Verbal nouns are commonly used as objects, eg:
            <br />
            some cleaning some repairing
            <br />
            some drawing some sewing

            <br />
            It will be noticed that several noun phrases collocate with both have and take. In such cases, have is the typical British verb and take is the typical American verb.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most of the subjects in clauses with an eventive object are agentive. But some are recipient (or experiencer, 10.21 Note [e]): Bill got a view of the candidate, I had a wonderful dream, Sally took an instant dislike to the new tenant. Others are affected: Saul took a fall, The team has taken a beating, At the sudden noise Bob gave a jump. The verbs do, make, offer, pay, and put always take agentive subjects<br />
            <br />
            [a] Haw can more easily take an affected subject than take: The baby&#39;s having a bath (also in AmE), generally not ?*The baby&#39;s taking a bath. Do and make overlap in the eventive objects they can take, but only do takes -ing verbal nouns. [b] The verbs vacation &lt;esp AmE) and holiday (esp BrE) are less usual than the expanded constructions. [c] Contrast: 1 She gave a shriek. [an involuntary shriek] \ She had a good sdriek. [voluntary and for own enjoyment] She did a (good) shriek. [a performance before an audience]
            <br />
            <br />
            Instrumental dbject
            <br />
            10.31 The object may occasionally be instrumental (cf 10.21):
            <br />
            We employ a computer for our calculations.
            <br />
            She is playing thepiano.
            <br />
            He nodded his head.
            <br />
           <br/>
            <pre>
Note Occasionally the notion of instrument is incorporated into the verb: 
He headed the ball into the goal. ['He hit the ball with his head . . .'l 
He kicked the ball into the goal. ['He hit the ball with his foot. . .'l 
This applies to nod, too: his head in the example in the text would be implied if omitted. 
</pre>
            <pre>
Affected indirect object 
, $$ 10.32 The indirect object normally takes the role of recipient (cf 10.19, and Note 
:B [c] below). It occasionally takes an affected role with a few of the verbs that 
<,l,- combine with an eventive object (cf 10.30). The most common verb in the g 
S g;< latter construction is give: 
She gave me a push. ['She pushed me.'] 
I gave Helen a nudge. ['I nudged Helen.'] 
We gave the baby a bath. ['We bathed the baby.'] 
I should give the car a wash. ['I should wash the car.'] 
Give the car a push. ['Push the car.'] 
Judith paid me a visit. ['Judith visited me.'] 
Derek owes us a treat. ['It's Derek's turn to treat us.'] 
The indirect object has the same role as the affected direct object in the 
paraphrases. Unlike the recipient indirect object, the affected indirect object 
is not normally paraphrasable by a prepositional phrase: 
I gave Helen a nudge. 
'L. ?I gave a nudge to Helen. </pre>
            <pre>
The reason is that this type of construction is intended to focus on the 
nominal equivalent of the verb (nudge in this example) and therefore the 
direct object should receive end-focus (cf 18.3fl. 
Note [a] In this use, giw may be compared with get, haw, and receiw in a parallel passive sense: Igot 
a surprise, The car has had apalish, I received a shock. There is also an interesting equivalence of 
They gaw (or shot) each other glances and They exchangedgtances ['They glanced at each other.]. 
[b] We should include here metaphorical uses of other verbs, where paraphrases indicate that 
the indirect object has an affected role: Itaught hima lesson [roughly 'I disciplined him.']. 
[c] The indirect object has the role of 'comitative' ['together with'] or perhaps 'opposition' in 
this example: 
I played Sam a game of chess. ['I played a game of chess withlagainst Sam.'] </pre>
            <pre>
Summary 
10.33 As a summary, we present in Table 10.33 over page the chief semantic 
functions for each clause type, with example sentences. Although, as the 
, table shows, the semantic functions of the elements (particularly S and Od) 
are quite varied, there are certain clear restrictions, such as that the object 
cannot be agentive; a subject (except in the passive) cannot be resultative; 
an indirect object normally has only two functions - those of affected and 
recipient. The following system of priorities generally obtains: l If there is an agentive, external causer, or positioner, it is S; if not, 
If there is an instrument, it is S; if not, 
If there is an affected, it is S; if not, 
I If there is a temporal, locative, or eventive, it may be S; if not, 
The prop word it is S. 
Naturally, in passive clauses the role of the direct or indirect object is 
assigned to the subject. </pre>

Subject-verb concord 
General rule 
10.34 CONCORD (also termed 'agreement') can be defined as the relationship 
between two grammatical units such that one of them displays a particular 
feature (eg plurality) that accords with a displayed (or semantically implicit) 
feature in the other. The most important type of concord in English is 
concord of 3rd person number between subject and verb. The normally 
observed rule is very simple: 
A singular subject requires a singular verb: 
My daughter watches television after supper. [singular subject + 
singular verb] 
A plural subject requires a plural verb: 
My daughters watch television after supper. [plural subject + 
plural verb] 
When the subject is realized by a noun phrase, the phrase counts as 
singular if its head is singular: 
The CHANGE in male attitudes is most obvious in industry. 
The CHANGES in male attitude are most obvious in industry. 
Finite and nonfinite clauses generally count as singular: 
How you got there doesn't concern me. 
To treat them as hostages is criminal. 
Smoking cigarettes is dangerous to your health. 
Prepositional phrases and adverbs functioning as subject (cf 10.15) also count 
as singular: 
In the evenings is best for me. Slowly does it! 
An apparent exception for clauses is the nominal relative clause. Nominal 
relative clauses are on the continuum from clause to noun phrase (cf 15.8f). 
For the purpose of concord, their number depends on the interpretation of 
the number of the wh-element. With the determiners what and whatever, the 
concord depends on the number of the determined noun. Contrast [3] and [4] 
below: 
What were supposed to be new proposals were in fact 
modifications of earlier ones. 111 
What was once a palace is now a pile of rubble. [a Whatever book a Times reviewer praises sells well. [31 
What ideas he has are his wife's. [4] 
A verb counts as singular if the first verb in a finite verb phrase has a 
singular form: 
no intention of spending a vacation with me. My sons have 
been sent to every applicant.</pre>
            <pre>
The application of the general rule is restricted in several general respects: 
(1) Except for the verb BE, the verb shows a distinction of number only in 
the 3rd person present. Hence, the verb generally does not show concord in 
the past: 
watched television after supper. My daughters 
The verb BE displays concord also in the 3rd person past: 
My daughter was watching television in my bedroom. 
My daughters were watching television in my bedroom. 
(2) Number concord is displayed only in the indicative. Nonfinite verbs, 
imperatives, and subjunctives make no number distinctions. 
(3) Modal auxiliaries (cf 3.39ff) make no number distinctions: 
may watch television after supper.</pre>
